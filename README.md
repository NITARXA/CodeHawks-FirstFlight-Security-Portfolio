# Smart Contract Audit Practice Portfolio

This repository contains my smart contract audit practice reports, created as part of my learning journey in smart contract auditing. 
The reports are based on the CodeHawks First Flights contest, which is a beginner-friendly smart contract audit challenge. 
Through these audits, I am building my skills in identifying vulnerabilities, performing code reviews, and documenting findings.

## Repository Contents

- **Audit Reports**: Detailed analysis and findings on various smart contracts, including identified vulnerabilities, proof of concepts (PoC), and suggested mitigations.
- **Smart Contract Code**: The code for the audited contracts, often derived from the First Flights contest.
- **Tests & Demos**: Test cases for verifying vulnerabilities and fixes, where applicable.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand common vulnerabilities in smart contracts such as reentrancy, gas issues, and miscalculations in reward distribution.
- Develop the ability to read and audit Solidity code effectively.
- Learn best practices for writing secure smart contracts and mitigating potential risks.

## Tools Used

- Solidity
- Foundry (for testing)
